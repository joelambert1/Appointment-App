Appointment scheduling app that uses Java, MySQL, Javafx

- Users can schedule appointments, add/edit customers and appointments as well as view reports and other relevant information.

The app will add a test user with password test if no users are in DB, it will also add Countries and associated cities if there are none already in the DB..
-- Each user's schedule can be filtered at the appointment menu

--- My program will translate the login page to spanish if that is the region selected, as well as
the login error messages
i used español españa to test

-- appointments can only be added once you add customers

-- doesn't provide an alert if the appointment has already passed, but if it is within
the next 15 minutes it will.

-- reports page, i found the busiest user and listed their # of appointments scheduled

in a .txt file. Each new record should be appended to the log file, if the file already exists.
